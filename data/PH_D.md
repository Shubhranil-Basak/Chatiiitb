The Master of Science degree is intended for mature students who wish to learn and perform research in a supportive academic environment. It is awarded upon successful completion of a graduate-level research program, usually lasting four semesters. Beyond the satisfaction of a relatively small number of coursework requirements, the major focus of the program is on developing research skills, leading to the completion of a Master's thesis describing significant original results. Most M.S. by Research students are working professionals (some already working as research scientists in reputed organizations or government bodies), who are sponsored by their employers.

The Doctor of Philosophy is the terminal, research-oriented degree in the subject, intended to prepare students for research, teaching, and scholarly careers in academic settings or research laboratories. It connotes a superior comprehension of the field and a high aptitude for research, and is awarded upon completion of a program that takes from 3 to 5 years (there are no hard limits). Beyond the satisfaction of a relatively small number of coursework requirements, the major focus is on carrying out a significant body of original research and the writing and defense of a doctoral dissertation describing this work.â€‹
