In addition to the IIITB scholarships, GATE-qualified students will be eligible for fellowships from AICTE as per AICTE norms. (across CSE and ECE)

# Accommodation

Since the M.Tech. programme is very demanding, and classes, tutorials and laboratory sessions often extend beyond regular working hours and during the weekends, staying at the hostel accommodation provided by the Institute is mandatory.

The male students admitted to the M.Tech. programme will be provided accommodation in an off-campus hostel facility arranged by IIITB. The female students will be provided hostel accommodation on campus itself. The hostel fee rates are applicable uniformly for all the students irrespective of the hostel location.
