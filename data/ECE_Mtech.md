# MTech ECE

The goal of postgraduate programmes at IIIT-Bangalore is to develop professionals of high quality to cater to the needs of industry and academia. Such education will be based on a broad grasp of the fundamental principles of the sciences and scientific methods, a deep understanding of a specific area of specialization, an ability to solve new problems, and a capacity to learn continually and interact with multidisciplinary groups. Above all, IIIT-Bangalore aims at developing in its students a capacity for free and objective inquiry, courage and integrity, and awareness and sensitivity to the needs and aspirations of society. The postgraduate programs are designed with the above goals in view. They include courses of study, seminars, project work, and internships, or research leading to a thesis.
 
M. Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) is a two-year (4-semester) programme. The programme has been approved by AICTE. The students enrolled need to earn at least 64 credits, with at least a CGPA of 2.4 (in a 4-point grading system) to graduate with an M. Tech (ECE) degree.
 
Students in the first semester will choose courses worth of 20 credits from the following list of courses:

* Digital CMOS VLSI Design (4 Credits)
* Analog CMOS VLSI Design (4 Credits)
* Physical Design of ASICs (4 Credits)
* Machine Learning (4 Credits)
* Mathematics for Machine Learning (4 Credits)
* Networking and Communication (4 Credits)
* Mobile Computing (4 Credits)
* System design with FPGA (4 Credits)
* Embedded Systems Design (4 Credits)

The students will choose 5 elective courses in the second semester and 3 in the third semester. Each M.Tech. (ECE) student should do SIX branch elective courses. The last semester will be Thesis/Internship. Depending on the elective courses students choose, M. Tech. (ECE) students have the option to specialize in one of the following listed areas:
 
1. AIML (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning).
2. TCS (Theoretical Computer Science).
3. SY (Software Systems).
4. NC (Networking and Communication).
5. VLSI (VLSI Systems).
6. DT (Digital Society).

From this year onwards, we will be admitting students with GATE ECE and GATE EE scores. The students with EE background will have to go through additional preparatory courses to cover prerequisite topics that are relevant for the M.Tech. ECE programme. This additional effort from students will be expected during the three weeks of preparatory semester in the Institute.

**Selection Procedure:  GATE (EC) or GATE (EE) SCORE**

**Intake:  30**

**All students enrolled in the M.Tech. programme are residential, full-time students.**

* Computer Science & Engineering
* Computer Engineering
* Information Technology
* Information Systems
* Electronics & Communication Engineering

# Course Fee

The students who are joining the programme in July 2024, will pay tuition fee Rs.2,30,000/- per semester. The total tuition fees for the entire duration of the programme (for students admitted in July 2024) will be Rs. 9,20,000/-

At the time of admission, every student need to pay Library Deposit of INR 4,000/- and Caution Deposit for Hostel INR 15,000/- which are refundable at the time of graduation.

Every student needs to pay insurance charges of Rs 2,000/- per year (subject to revision every year).

Other costs for books and supplies, travel, purchase of a laptop, etc. need to be factored by students themselves depending on their individual circumstances/needs.

# Scholarships

The Institute has offered about 5 scholarships (out of the 150+ students admitted in 2023) to meritorious students joining the M.Tech programme (CSE + ECE). The Institute expects to offer a similar number of industry-funded scholarships in 2024 as well. The scholarship amount covers almost all student expenses over the duration of their M. Tech programme. The selection for these industry-sponsored scholarships is carried out by the industry representatives along with IIITB faculty coordinators.

In addition to the IIITB scholarships, GATE-qualified students will be eligible for fellowships from AICTE as per AICTE norms. (across CSE and ECE)

# Accommodation

Since the M.Tech. programme is very demanding, and classes, tutorials and laboratory sessions often extend beyond regular working hours and during the weekends, staying at the hostel accommodation provided by the Institute is mandatory.

The male students admitted to the M.Tech. programme will be provided accommodation in an off-campus hostel facility arranged by IIITB. The female students will be provided hostel accommodation on campus itself. The hostel fee rates are applicable uniformly for all the students irrespective of the hostel location.

Queries related to admission: please write to IIIT-B Registrar or admissions-mtech@iiitb.ac.in if you have any queries.
