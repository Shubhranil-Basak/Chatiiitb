**For IIIT Bangalore Students:**

Our final year Mtech, Integrated Mtech (iMtech) and MSc Digital Society students are eligible for the student Exchange Program from Jan to June (about 6 months). Our third and fourth year iMtech students are also available for the summer Exchange Program (about 3 months).

The students choosing the 6 months Exchange Program typically do a project or research related to their chosen degree. Only final year students who have chosen this programme will be given credits as it is a part of the curriculum.

Other students can opt to go for this programme only during the summer break without earning credits. The host university might choose to give completion letters or recommendations to the students.

Over the last several years, many of our students have visited universities spread over different continents, from North America to Europe to Asia.

Support may be available in the form of scholarships by IIIT Bangalore or the host university.

We encourage international students to be a part of our student community. In addition to offering several interdisciplinary programmes, IIIT Bangalore is a part of several ecosystems within India, for eg.
