They also provide them clothes and money contributed by the students, along with sweets and crackers so that they could mingle with us on the occasion. They frequently collect articles like clothes, food and books from the students and donate them to the needy.  last year on Eid, they collected these articles and donated them to the Goonj society.

‘Aikyam Trips’ is to visit orphanages occasionally and spend their day with the children there. They buy the necessary items for the children there and also give the funds collected to the orphanage.

Lean-In club in IIIT-Bangalore is a female-students club that was started in 2018. The aim was to build a close-knit group to guide and support more and more women who wish to make their career in tech. 

We conduct various sessions and workshops on Open Source programs, Research opportunities, Competitive programming and other domains of IT. These sessions cover a wide range of activities - resume building, getting started with open source and git, interview preparation tips, introduction to machine learning, data structures and coding, how to start a research career, reviewing applications etc. We also invite female speakers (ex: alumni) to deliver talks on their career (ex: how to build a startup). All these activities provide girls with various opportunities to interact with people from different technical backgrounds and explore multiple avenues for growth. 

Giving women equal opportunities and motivating them to thrive in STEM careers would help in reducing the gender gap that exists in this field. We wish to achieve this and build a diverse and talented community in tech.
