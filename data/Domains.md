Documents still constitute a significant content type in the enterprise today. Document Engineering deals with developing algorithms, techniques, tools and processes that help in creating and manipulating the content, format, and representation of documents. There are several challenges being addressed as part of Document Engineering. The DocEng lab explores the various standards and tools available in this space. Following are some of the projects from the Lab:

**Information Convergence Lab (Prof. Chandrashekar Ramanathan)**
The revolution of mobile phones made media convergence possible. Today we don't need separate devices for talking on the phone, listening to music, watching videos, surfing the Internet, reading/sending e-mails. Information convergence is a similar concept that is focused on interoperability of information scattered across multiple dimensions and multiple sources and destinations. The focus of the Information Convergence Lab (I-COG Lab) is to first identify and define various information convergence challenges that are relevant to the real world. The current focus of the lab is to start with a study of information convergence challenges specifically targeted at large enterprises and the government. Based on this understanding of the needs and contexts of information convergence, the lab will specify reusable frameworks that address these challenges in a unified and integrated environment. The focus would be to develop standards-based solutions that can be applied widely.
 
**Multimodal Perception Lab (Prof. Dinesh Babu Jayagopi)**

Probabilistic graphical models form the backbone of the underlying formalism.
 
**Speech Recognition (Prof. V. Ramasubramanian)**
The research focus related to automatic speech recognition is on current trends in deep-learning and machine-learning with a broader objective of integrating speech-specific knowledge and structures into the emerging neural architectural frameworks.

# Mathematics and Basic Science

The research at IIIT-B in Mathematics and Physics are given here.

**Faculty Members**

* **Prof. Manisha Kulkarni**
    Research in MATHEMATICS is principally in the area of Number Theory; in particular, Algebraic Number Theory, Galois Representations, Modular Forms, Iwasawa Theory, Diophantine Equations, Galois Module structure and Elliptic curves. Research is also conducted in the fields of Algebraic Complexity Theory and Cryptography. The following two problems are representative of the mathematics research in IIIT-B: Let E be an elliptic curve over number field K. For every prime P where E has good reduction at P, we get one imaginary quadratic field associated to E. We are trying to see if we can get all imaginary quadratic fields by this procedure?
