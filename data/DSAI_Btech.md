IIIT-Bangalore is launching a 4-year B.Tech. (DSAI) programme in the year 2024. The aim of the programme is to produce high-quality graduates in the emerging areas of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) who are well-equipped with the skills required to solve real-world problems. The job opportunities for graduates with DSAI skills are on the rise. This programme will prepare a well-prepared and motivated workforce to pursue careers in research and industry involving innovation, knowledge creation, engineering and entrepreneurship.

The B.Tech. (DSAI) programme follows a flexible curriculum that covers the theoretical underpinnings of data science, statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The curriculum places due importance on the foundational aspects of DSAI, as well as develops in students the necessary engineering skills for addressing emerging technological challenges. After five semesters of foundational courses, students from the sixth semester onwards register for elective courses under the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) as recommended by AICTE and other regulatory bodies. In the 8th semester, students may opt for a thesis or internship in a well-recognized organization.

Students interested in the core of the DSAI domain are encouraged to specialize in one of the following domains by earning an additional 20 credits in that specific area. Students completing the DSAI specialization (Non-Minor) with a CGPA above or equal to 3.5/4.0 will graduate with a B.Tech. (Honours) in DSAI.

**Specializations:**

    1. DSAI Algorithms
    2. DSAI in Data Domains (e.g., NLP, Vision)

Alternatively, students can earn a Minor in a non-DSAI area by successfully completing an additional 20 credits in the chosen area. The Minor could be in one of the following areas:

    1. VLSI (VLSI Systems)
    2. SY (Software Systems)
    3. DT (Digital Society)

Note: The above lists of areas are subject to change and refinement from time to time.

**Qualification Requirements:**
The minimum qualification required for admission to the B.Tech. and the Integrated M.Tech. programmes at IIIT-B is a first-class in 10 + 2 (or equivalent) with Mathematics as one of the subjects. Students expecting to complete the minimum requirement by July 2024 may also apply.

# Selection Procedure
